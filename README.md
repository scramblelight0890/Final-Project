# Final-Project
1. Overview
1. I have always been interested in games of stategy (and I know checkers isn't technically strategy, but I couldn't make chess) and I wanted a game that I could easily play. (Yes, it looks hard initially but it gets easier.)

2. This project was interesting to me because it has a lot of moving parts. I just wanted to make something visual (not just words on a screen) and I think I have achieved that.

3. So far (as of this submission), I have completed a checkers game that works completely, except the o's don't turn into *'s and it doesn't tell you who wins. But, I plan to work on that once I'm done writing this up.

4. I learned that there is a lot you can do with just individual characters. I made a whole checkers board with just characters and colors, and that is really amazing to me.

2. Diagrams
1. 
2. 
3. I don't really know how to copy a diagram to this so I'll send you these seperately.

3. Comments--yes

4. Tests--yes(kind of)

5. Implementation

1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Elements:
-2. I have passed numerous things by reference in all of my methods.
-3. The inputs get turned into arrays for easier (I think) use.
-5. The checkers board is a two-dimensional array.
-6. If statements are used to verify that the input is within the parameters.
-8. I have two methods called Print() and Winner()
-9. I have two more methods called Jump() and Ask()
-10. I have a while loop to verify if someone has won.
-11. Two for loops allow me to print the checkers board.
-16. The user has to input what piece they want to move, and where they wish to move it.
-This isn't on there, but I have catching exceptions if that counts for #10
